<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The double mechanical seals market is categorized into two main types: pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals feature a dynamic secondary seal that maintains contact with the primary seal during operation, ensuring effective sealing under varying conditions. In contrast, non-pusher seals rely on a stationary secondary seal, providing a more straightforward design with fewer moving parts. Both types are essential in applications requiring reliability and durability, particularly in industries like petrochemical, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenge Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle airbag inflator market comprises three main types: Pyrotechnic Inflators, Stored Gas Inflators, and Hybrid Inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators use chemical reactions to generate gas for airbag deployment, offering rapid inflation. Stored gas inflators rely on pre-compressed gas, providing a smoother and cooler deployment. Hybrid inflators combine both methods, using a small pyrotechnic charge to release stored gas, balancing speed and temperature control. Each type caters to specific safety and performance requirements, influencing their adoption in modern vehicles.</p></p>

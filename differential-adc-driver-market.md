<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential ADC Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-ended</li><li>Pseudo-differential</li><li>Fully-differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Differential ADC Driver market consists of three main types: Single-ended, Pseudo-differential, and Fully-differential. </p><p>Single-ended drivers convert a single input signal to a corresponding output without a reference voltage, commonly used in low-cost applications. Pseudo-differential drivers utilize a single-ended signal along with a ground reference, offering better noise cancellation. Fully-differential drivers, on the other hand, amplify the difference between two input signals and reject common-mode noise, making them ideal for high-performance applications that demand improved linearity and reduced interference.</p></p>

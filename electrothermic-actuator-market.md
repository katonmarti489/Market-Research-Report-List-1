<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrothermic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Type</li><li>Normally Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrothermic actuator market comprises primarily two types: normally closed and normally open actuators. Normally closed types maintain their position until an electrical signal is applied, which opens the mechanism, making them ideal for safety applications. Conversely, normally open types remain open until actuated, which is useful in systems requiring immediate flow control upon receiving a signal. Both types play crucial roles in automation, HVAC systems, and industrial processes, enhancing efficiency and precision in fluid control management.</p></p>
